# Laser-cut case for MiSTer FPGA project

Plans for a laser-cut case for the [MiSTer](https://github.com/MiSTer-devel/Main_MiSTer/wiki/How-to-start-with-MiSTer) FPGA project and add-on boards.

There are many options for 3D printed cases for the MiSTer project, but I haven't been able to find any open source plans for those of us with access to a laser cutter. I designed this case to fit my specific configuration of MiSTer: 

* DE10 Nano FPGA board
* IO Board 5.6 XL
* USB Hub 1.2

It should be easy to modify for other configurations.

Extra brass standoffs will be required in addition to those supplied with the DE-10 Nano and IO boards.

Plans are supplied in Affinity Desinger, SVG and WMF format (WMF works best for my cheap 40W Chinese laser cutter).
